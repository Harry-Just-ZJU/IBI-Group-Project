# This is our Group Project for IBI 2024-25.

## Here are 4 group members:

### Feiyang Dong  



## This project is aimed to analyse user-specified mRNA sequences.
## It contains four small sub-tasks.

### 1. Most frequent nucleotide

It can report the most frequent DNA trinucleotide for any user-specified mRNA sequence.
It is able to identify the start codon and three different stop codons.

### 2. Most frequent amino acid

It can compute the encoded amino acid for the most frequent nucleotide for any user-specified mRNA sequence.
It is able to identify the start codon and three different stop codons.

### 3. Amino acid frequencies

It can automatically plot the frequency distribution of encoded amino acids across any user-specific mRNA sequence.
It is able to identify the start codon and three different stop codons.

### 4. PolyA
